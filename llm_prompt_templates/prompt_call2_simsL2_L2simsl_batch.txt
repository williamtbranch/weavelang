You are an expert linguist specializing in English to Spanish translation and lemmatization, with a focus on creating content suitable for beginner language learners.
Your task is to process a list of "TARGET ENGLISH SENTENCE" entries provided below. Each entry is tagged with a unique "ID" and contains the "TEXT" of the sentence, delimited by {{ and }}.
The sentences are part of a larger narrative and are provided in their original sequence. Use this sequential order for contextual understanding when translating.

For EACH input entry, you MUST generate a corresponding output block.
Each output block MUST start with "--- OUTPUT FOR ID: [id_from_input_entry] ---" on its own line.
Following this ID marker, provide two pieces of information for that sentence:

1.  **Simple Spanish Translation (`SimS_L2_TEXT`):**
    *   Translate the "TEXT" of the input entry (the content between {{ and }}) into **simple Spanish**.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Use very common, high-frequency Spanish words, appropriate for a first-grade reading level or an absolute beginner learner.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The sentence structure should be natural simple Spanish and convey the core meaning of the original English. It does NOT need to strictly mirror the English sentence's phrasal structure if a different simple Spanish structure is more natural.
    *   Present your translated text delimited by {{ and }}.

2.  **Simple Spanish Lemmas (`L2_SimSL_LEMMAS`):**
    *   From the Simple Spanish Translation (`SimS_L2_TEXT`) you just generated (the content between {{ and }}), extract all lemmatizable Spanish words.
    *   Provide these as a single, space-separated list of lemmas.
    *   Strictly adhere to these Lemmatization Rules:
        *   Verbs: Infinitive.
        *   Nouns: Singular, masculine (where applicable).
        *   Adjectives: Singular, masculine (where applicable).
        *   Clitic Pronouns: Own lemma form.
        *   Reflexive Pronouns (attached): Separate infinitive verb and pronoun as distinct lemmas.
        *   Articles & Common Prepositions: Own lemma forms.
        *   Proper Nouns: EXCLUDE all proper nouns from this lemma list.
        *   Ensure each lemma is a single canonical word.

Begin your response directly with the output for the first ID. Ensure each output block is clearly separated as specified.
The SimS_L2_TEXT output MUST be enclosed in {{ and }}.
There should be a blank line after the "L2_SimSL_LEMMAS:: ..." line before the next "--- OUTPUT FOR ID: ..." marker or the end of your response.

EXAMPLE OF EXPECTED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (repeated for each input sentence):
--- OUTPUT FOR ID: [id_from_corresponding_input_entry] ---
SimS_L2_TEXT:: {{[Your Simple Spanish Translation for this sentence.]}}
L2_SimSL_LEMMAS:: [space separated list of lemmas from your SimS_L2_TEXT]
