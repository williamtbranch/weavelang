You are an expert linguist specializing in Spanish sentence segmentation and lemmatization.
Your task is to process a list of "ADVANCED SPANISH SENTENCES" provided below. Each sentence is tagged with a unique "ID" and its "AdvS_TEXT_TO_SEGMENT" (previously translated advanced Spanish text, delimited by {{ and }}).
For context, the "ORIGINAL ENGLISH TEXT" (also delimited by {{ and }}) from which the AdvS_TEXT was derived is also provided for each entry.

For EACH input entry (ADVANCED SPANISH SENTENCE), you must:

1.  **Segment the `AdvS_TEXT_TO_SEGMENT` (`AdvS_SEGMENTS`):**
    *   Break down the input `AdvS_TEXT_TO_SEGMENT` (the content between {{ and }}) into a sequence of meaningful, consecutive phrase segments. Aim for natural phrase breaks.
    *   Assign sequential IDs to these segments starting with "A1", then "A2", and so on.
    *   **Crucial:** The concatenation of your generated segment texts (with single spaces between them) MUST perfectly reconstruct the original input `AdvS_TEXT_TO_SEGMENT`. Do not omit words or change phrasing from the input `AdvS_TEXT_TO_SEGMENT`; simply divide it.
    *   Output each segment as `[SegmentID]::{{[Segment Text]}}`.

2.  **Provide Lemmas for Each Segment (`AdvSL_PER_SEGMENT`):**
    *   For each `AdvS_Segment` text you just created, extract all lemmatizable Spanish words from *that specific segment's text*.
    *   Provide these as a space-separated list of lemmas, prefixed by the segment's ID (e.g., `A1:: lemma1 lemma2`).
    *   Strictly adhere to these Lemmatization Rules:
        *   Verbs: Infinitive.
        *   Nouns: Singular, masculine (where applicable).
        *   Adjectives: Singular, masculine (where applicable).
        *   Clitic Pronouns: Own lemma form.
        *   Reflexive Pronouns (attached): Separate infinitive verb and pronoun.
        *   Articles & Common Prepositions: Own lemma forms.
        *   Proper Nouns: EXCLUDE from lemma lists.
        *   Each lemma: single canonical word.

--- EXAMPLE OF TASK ---
IF THE INPUT ENTRY IS:
--- INPUT (ID: example_id_001) ---
ORIGINAL_ENGLISH_TEXT: {{"The man was limping intently on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to hook himself up again."}}
AdvS_TEXT_TO_SEGMENT: {{El hombre cojeaba con determinación hacia este último, como si fuera el pirata que había cobrado vida, y había bajado, y regresaba para colgarse de nuevo.}}

YOUR EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR THIS ENTRY WOULD BE:
--- OUTPUT FOR ID: example_id_001 ---
AdvS_SEGMENTS_START::
A1::{{El hombre}}
A2::{{cojeaba con determinación}}
A3::{{hacia este último,}}
A4::{{como si fuera el pirata}}
A5::{{que había cobrado vida,}}
A6::{{y había bajado,}}
A7::{{y regresaba}}
A8::{{para colgarse de nuevo.}}
AdvS_SEGMENTS_END::

AdvSL_PER_SEGMENT_START::
A1::el hombre
A2::cojear con determinación
A3::hacia este último
A4::como si ser el pirata
A5::que haber cobrar vida
A6::y haber bajar
A7::y regresar
A8::para colgar se de nuevo
AdvSL_PER_SEGMENT_END::

For EACH input sentence, provide your output in the structured format shown in the example's "YOUR EXPECTED OUTPUT" section.
Begin your response directly with the output for the first ID.
Ensure a blank line after AdvSL_PER_SEGMENT_END:: before the next "--- OUTPUT FOR ID: ..." marker or the end of your response.
