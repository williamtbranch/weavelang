You are an expert linguist specializing in creating structurally aligned translations for language learning and in Spanish lemmatization.
Your task is to process a list of "TARGET ENGLISH SENTENCES". Each input entry is tagged with a unique "ID" and its "ENG_TEXT" (original English text, delimited by {{ and }}).

For EACH input "ID" and its "ENG_TEXT", you must perform the following three related tasks:

1.  **Generate Simple Spanish Segments (`SimS_L3_SEGMENTS`) Aligned to English:**
    *   Analyze the input `ENG_TEXT` (content between {{ and }}) to understand its phrasal structure.
    *   Translate the `ENG_TEXT` into **simple Spanish**, outputting this translation as a sequence of phrase segments.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Use very common, high-frequency Spanish words (first-grade reading level).
    *   **Structural Alignment:** Each generated simple Spanish segment MUST correspond in meaning and phrase boundary to a conceptual phrase in the input `ENG_TEXT`.
    *   **Completeness:** The concatenation of your generated simple Spanish segment texts (with single spaces) MUST form a complete, grammatically correct simple Spanish sentence that accurately translates the entire input `ENG_TEXT`.
    *   Assign sequential IDs to these segments (S1, S2, S3...).
    *   Output each segment as `[SegmentID]::{{[Simple Spanish Segment Text]}}`.

2.  **Align Segments to English Spans (`PHRASE_ALIGN_SimS_L3_TO_ENG`):**
    *   For each simple Spanish segment you created in Task 1 (e.g., S1, S2):
        *   Identify the exact span of text from the original input `ENG_TEXT` that this Spanish segment corresponds to.
        *   Output this alignment as `[SegmentID] ~ {{[Your Simple Spanish Segment Text from Task 1]}} ~ {{[Corresponding Span from Original ENG_TEXT]}}`.

3.  **Provide Lemmas for Simple Spanish Segments (`L3_SimSL_PER_SEGMENT`):**
    *   For each simple Spanish segment text you created in Task 1:
        *   Extract all lemmatizable Spanish words from *that specific segment's text*.
        *   Provide these as a space-separated list of lemmas, prefixed by the segment's ID (e.g., `S1:: lemma1 lemma2`).
    *   Strictly adhere to standard Lemmatization Rules (Verbs:Infinitive; Nouns:Singular,Masculine; Adjectives:Singular,Masculine; Clitics:OwnForm; Reflexive:Separate; Articles/Prepositions:OwnForm; ProperNouns:EXCLUDE).

--- EXAMPLE OF TASK FOR ONE INPUT SENTENCE (ID: example_id_001) ---
IF THE INPUT ENTRY IS:
--- INPUT (ID: example_id_001) ---
ENG_TEXT: {{"The man was limping carefully towards the gibbet, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to hook himself up again."}}

YOUR EXPECTED OUTPUT FOR THIS "ID: example_id_001" ENTRY WOULD BE:
--- OUTPUT FOR ID: example_id_001 ---

S2::{{caminaba con cuidado}}
S3::{{a la horca,}}
S4::{{como si fuera el pirata}}

S7::{{y volvía}}
S8::{{para ponerse arriba otra vez.}}

For EACH input "ID" entry, provide your output in the structured format shown in the example.
Begin your response directly with the output for the first ID.
Ensure a blank line after L3_SimSL_PER_SEGMENT_END:: before the next "--- OUTPUT FOR ID: ..." marker or the end of your response.
